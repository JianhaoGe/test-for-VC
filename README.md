This explicit Github repository stores the detailed instructions, desensitized data and part of computer programming in Matlab. The described method is used to reproduce the results shown in the paper named "Transport Capacity Analysis for Sharing-Corridor Metro Lines under Virtual Coupling". 
Due to the confidentiality agreements, we have desensitized the data. Readers can still obtain optimized schedules based on our model with the desensitized data input and obtain approximate results. Besides, in order to assist readers in reproducing our results, we have also uploaded the code for calculating capacity utilization (in Fig.7). Readers can input their optimized timetable to calculate the capacity utilization under virtual coupling conditions using this code.
We are willing to see further development from our research results.
