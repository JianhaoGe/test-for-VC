This explicit Github repository stores the detailed instructions, desensitized data and pseudocodes for computer programming in Matlab. The described method is used to reproduce the results shown in the paper named "Transport Capacity Analysis for Sharing-Corridor Metro Lines under Virtual Coupling". 
Due to the confidentiality agreements, we are unable to directly upload the computer programming models with detailed codes and related actual data. Instead, related pseudocodes for computer programming with detailed instructions and desensitized data are uploaded to help readers to reproduce the results.
We are willing to see further development from our research results.
